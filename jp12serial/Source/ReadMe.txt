Source Code for Version 0.23 of jp12serial.dll

* This version adds support for JP2 and similar remotes where the EEPROM area starts on	a flash page boundary but may not consist of a whole number of flash pages.  The only known example at present is the URC7955 where the EEPROM length is 0xFFC, four bytes short of two 0x800-byte flash pages.  getRemoteEepromSize() reports the true size of the EEPROM area but readRemote(...) and writeRemote(...) allow reading and writing within the whole of the flash pages containing the EEPROM area.

Source Code for Version 0.22 of jp12serial.dll

* This version adds support for JP3.1.  This is a 32-bit version of JP1.4N but with an important timing difference.  There is a delay of nearly 5 seconds between sending a GetInfo request and the arrival of the response.  To allow for this, ReadSerial() has been modified to accept an additional optional parameter, a maximum wait duration in seconds as a double.  A safety feature has also been added to prevent other interface types being tried if the remote passes initial tests as being JP1.4/JP2 but the call to jp2_14GetInfoAndSig() fails.  It is possible that testing for other types may corrupt a JP1.4/JP2 remote.

* This version also supports JP2N, which is a variant of JP2 with the same new signature block structure as used in JP1.4N.

Source Code for Version 0.21 of jp12serial.dll

* added support for the new version (JP1.4N) of JP1.4 that has a different structure for its signature block from that of JP1.4 or JP2.

Source Code for Version 0.20 of jp12serial.dll

* added support for remotes with address range > 64KB (JP3)

* corrected error causing one page too many to be erased during write operations

* Detection of FTDI chips modified by Graham Dixon (mathdon) to recognise the new FT230X chip used in Tommy Tyler's new interface leads and widgets.

Source Code for Version 0.19 of jp12serial.dll

* support for the new communications protocol used by JP1.4 and JP2 remotes added by Dave Reed (3FG)

* modified from beta version 0.18f_JP2 to handle an issue for these remotes when using transistor-based interfaces.

Source Code for Version 0.18 of jp12serial.dll

* added Mac OS X support for FTDI based cable

* dynamically searches for plugged-in cables because there are no builtin serial / parallel devices and the name of the USB 
  devices contain the serial number of the FTDI chip

* cleaned up error handling for hSerial: always use INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE instead of NULL

Source Code for Version 0.17 of jp12serial.dll

The C++ source code of version 0.17 contains four files that were not needed in versions 0.14 and earlier.  These are

* ftdi.cpp and ftdi.h which contain the functions used to locate USB ports with connected FTDI RS232 chips and to determine the virtual COM port to which they correspond;

* ftd2xx.h which is supplied by FTDI as part of its driver package and which provides the interface to the ftd2xx.dll file of that driver;

* StdAfx.h which only contains a few minimal settings.

The files ftdi.cpp and ftdi.h are used also in Version 2.01 of IRScope.exe and the first of these requires StdAfx.h.  This is why the minimal settings in that file are not simply incorporated into the other files.  A different StdAfx.h is used for IRScope.exe.

These additional files are not needed for compilation under Linux or Solaris.  Those operating systems do not support the FTDI Combined Driver Model that is needed to enable jp12serial.dll to give search priority to USB ports with connected FTDI RS232 chips.  The files needed to support that feature are therefore not required and the feature will be missing from those versions.

The source code of version 0.17 also includes one file that was not present in that for version 0.16.  This is Makefile.Linux.  As its name implies, this file is not needed for compilation under Windows.

The compiled version for Windows that has been issued was compiled with the g++ compiler of MinGW.

This JP1.x serial library was originally written by Greg Bush but has been modified recently by many others.  See the comments in the file jp12serial.cpp for more details of these recent developments.
