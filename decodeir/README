DecodeIR README
===============

This code is in Public Domain

DecodeIR is a general library which can decode signals for a large number
of infrared remote controls. It can be used as a regular C library or
through a java interface.

Here is a traditional C++ so-lib and a Java wrapper which are built
separately. The so-lib serves both as a traditional library and a
jni one for the java wrapper.

To build the java jar file you need maven. 'mvn package' will create
a jar file in the target/ directory. Here is no explicit support to
install this file.

To configure, build and install the so-lib you need the autoreconf
command and some other dependencies:

    autoconf v 2.69+
    automake v 1.14+
    libtool v 2.4.2+
    gnu make v 4.0.3+
    maven v v 3.2.2+
    gcc v 4.9.2+
    java-1.8.0-openjdk+


With these  in place, the build procedure is indeed:

    $ autoreconf -fi
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

There are no specific configuration options. The generic options to
configure and 'make install' are described in INSTALL. Static library
generation is disabled in configure.ac.
